I have a passion for using data to tell stories and discover meaningful insights.  I have been a hobbiest programmer most of life and discovered Data Science and Analytics on accident while looking for methods to automate work projects such as creating advanced spreadsheet formulas for cleaning and merging.  At one point I even installed a SuperSQL in Google Sheets as a means to create a locaized database because discovering python and other modern data handling methods.

I'm currently based out of Orlando, FL where I am currenlty enrolled in an MS Data Analytics (Big Data) program at the University of Central Florida.  When I'm not programming or reading about Data Science you can usually find my playing with photography, practicing yoga, or learning to cook some korean/indian food.
