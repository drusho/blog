Twitter | Github | Linkedin | Tableau . . Introduction . About the Data . . The Data comes from Florida Department of Health. They release several reports throughout the years that list the number of postive covid-19 cases by school. The school types include Elementary, Middle, High School, Charter/Prepatory Schools, and University/Colleges. The data is presented on a pdf, is in wide format, and data is not labeled by school type. . Also, the version of Tableau that is being used is Tableau Public. This means that the data that is export will need to be in excel format. . Data Cleaning . Import Data . import pandas as pd . . #import pdf and filter cols/rows df = pd.read_csv(&#39;schools_latest.csv&#39;,usecols=[0,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19],skiprows=5) df.sample(2) . .

            "content": ". . Notebook Created by David Rusho . Github Repository for this Notebook . | Other Social Media Links: . Twitter | Github | Linkedin | Tableau . | . . Introduction . About the Data . What is Reddit? . . Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members. . . Subreddits . . Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called &quot;communities&quot; or &quot;subreddits&quot;, which cover a variety of topics such as news, politics, religion, science, movies, video games, music, books, sports, fitness, cooking, pets, and image-sharing. . . Upvotes/Downvotes . . Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough up-votes, ultimately on the site&#39;s front page . . Subreddit Tabs . . At the top of each page on Reddit, you will see a selection of tabs marked Hot, New, Rising, Controversial, Top, Gilded, and Wiki. . Hot posts are the posts that have been getting the most upvotes and comments recently on that subreddit. This is the tab that will be used for this notebook. . Project Goals . This notebook will focus on &#39;Hot&#39; subreddit tab posts due to their focus on upvotes and recent comments. Data from /r/politics will be scrapped using python library Praw. Analysis will include determining top posts for this subreddit and understanding what factors contributed to their ranking beyond most upvotes and comments. Such as the correlation between comments and points, word frequency and semantic analysis of post titles . Summary of Results . Correlation of Post Score and Number of Comments . . A heatmap that was ran through Seaborn showed there was a very positive correlation between the number of comments and the score of a posts (0.89). . . Word Frequency of Post Titles . . Word frequency showed that Biden and Trump were the most popular key words, followed by GOP. . . Sentiment Analysis . The majority of posts in /r/politics were found be neutral, followed by negative. . Data Collection and Cleaning .

Github Repository for this Notebook | Tableau Dashboard for Fireworks Inuries (2016-2021) *Dashboard uses data from this notebook | . | . . Other Social Media Links: . Twitter | Github | Linkedin | Tableau . | . . Introduction . Fireworks in the US are commonly used during the 4th of July and New Years&#39; celebrations. Besides being nice to look at fireworks also cause a lot of apparent problems. . Fires . &quot;More than one-quarter (28 percent) of fires started by fireworks in 2014–2018 were reported on the Fourth of July.&quot; . Personal Injury . &quot;The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) estimates that 9,100 consumer fireworks-related injuries were seen in US hospital emergency departments in 2018.&quot; . Project Goals . To provide an overview of the types of incidents that involve fireworks. This includes understanding which age groups are most affected and the frequency of injury types. Insights from this analysis may help prevent future injuries or at least assist with increasing awareness of the dangers that fireworks can cause. . In addition to the above analysis, we&#39;ll take a look into sales data for all US states for the last five years (2016-2021). . Summary of Results . Age group of 0-20 showed the highest rate of injury. . . . Injuries to the hands, face, and eyes were the most common, while injuries to lower extremities were less common. . . . Missouri held the record for most spent on fireworks (over 250 million dollars over the past 5 years). . . . There was no significate correlation between the number of injuries in a year compared to the number of sales. .

Count 0.529818 | -0.590087 | 1.000000 | . Conclusion . Injuries . Age groups of 0-20 showed the highest rate of injury. Injury rates by age decrease with age tend to slowly decrease after age 20. The 60+ age groups showed the lowest rate of injury. . Injuries to the hands, face, and eyes were the most common, while injuries to lower extremities were less common. This is reflected numerous times in the data, such as with word frequency of injury narratives, where an explanation is given for how a person was injured. . Time series analysis showed that the month of July has the highest frequency of firework related injuries. . Sales . Missouri held the record for most spent on fireworks (over 250 million dollars over the past 5 years). For comparison, Alaska spent around 560,000 dollars in the last five years. Sales for fireworks saw a considerable increase in sales during 2020, most likely due to COVID-19. . Correlation Between Sales and Injury Counts . There was no significate correlation between the number of injuries in a year compared to the number of sales. . Ending Remarks . Never hold fireworks while lighting them, and hand, eye, and face protection should be worn at all times when fireworks are nearby fireworks. This is especially true if you are a male below the age of 21. . Tools Used . Matplotlib | Pandas | Plotly | Seaborn | Resources .

The following notebook represents steps that were taken to organize and clean 5 excel files that consist of incident reports involving fireforks over the past 5 years from the CPSC (United States Consumer Product Safety Commision). . The data needed to be converted to csv since reading excel into pandas is extremely slow. CSV did create larger files but the trade off for increased reading speeds was worth it. This was done manually through Excel and then exporting each file as a csv. If there were more files a more &quot;pythonic&quot; method would have been used to save time. . Begin Cleaning Process .

I have been a hobbiest programmer most of life and discovered Data Science and Analytics on accident while looking for methods to automate work projects such as creating advanced spreadsheet formulas for cleaning and merging. At one point I even installed a SuperSQL in Google Sheets as a means to create a locaized database because discovering python and other modern data handling methods. . I’m currently based out of Orlando, FL where I am currenlty enrolled in an MS Data Analytics (Big Data) program at the University of Central Florida. When I’m not programming or reading about Data Science you can usually find my playing with photography, practicing yoga, or learning to cook some korean/indian food. .",
