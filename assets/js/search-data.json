            "content": ". Introduction . Goals . Goals Provide an overview of incidents that involve fireworks. - Age Group(s) most affected - Frequency of Injury Type(s) Provide sales figures for fireworks across the US. - State sales totals all states Conclusions . Injury Data - Age Group(s) most affected - 0-20 age group showed the highest rate of injury. - Injury rates by age decreased with age - 60+ age groups showed the lowest rate of injury - Frequency of Injury Type(s) - Hand, Face, and Eye injuries were the most common. - Injuries to lower extemities were less common Sales Data - The state of Missouri held the record for most spent on fireworks (over $250 million over the past 5 years). - For comparision, Alaska spent around $560,000 with the last five years Resources . Source 1 1. Source (Injury Data): [Firework Injury Reports](https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/NEISSQuery/UserCriteria.aspx?UserAff=5x08cgz9T6YPDAZJzvlZjA%3d%3d&amp;UserAffOther=9OYR9kUytIsLilKZieD5xg%3d%3d) Consisted multiple excel incident reports involving fireworks over the past 5 years taken from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). NEISS injury data are gathered from the emergency departments (ED) of 96 hospitals selected as a probability sample of all U.S. hospitals with 24-hour EDs and at least 6 inpatient beds. Each participating NEISS hospital is hand-selected by CPSC because it provides an important representation of all other hospitals of its size and unique characteristics in the U.S. Source 2 2.

The number of people injuried with positive results for drug or alcohol use was very insignificant compared to overall count of injuries. . Visualizing Incident Counts by Year (Bar Plot) . Fixing Age Column . The Age column list not only numeric ages but also includes category codes for individuals under the age of 2 year old. Individuals that are under 2 years old are given a code starting with 200 combined with their age in months. . Age Code . Age Code Description . 0 | No Recorded Age | . 2 | 2 Years Old | . 45 | 45 Years Old | . 100 | 100 Years Old | . 102 | 102 Years Old | . 201 | Three Weeks Old | . 201 | Four Weeks Old | . 201 | Seven Weeks Old | . 202 | Ten Weeks Old | . 209 | Nine Months Old | . 212 | Twelve months (one year) | . 218 | Eighteen months | . If the patient is older than 115 years old, code the age as 115 and indicate the actual age in the Comment. If the ED record indicates the patient was born on January 1, 1900, please verify the patient’s age with hospital staff – some hospitals use this date when the patient’s age is unknown. . Note&lt;/summary Note: CPSC prefers that coders use the Date of Birth variable in lieu of the age variable. Mistakes in coded ages are common when patients have birthdays after the date of treatment and before the NEISS coder codes the case. Hospital medical record systems automatically update the age of the patient daily. &lt;/details&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Visualizing Age Groups (Histogram) . The histogram below shows that the majority of firework related injuries that were reported occured with indivuals under the age of 40. The largest grouping belonged to individuals under the age of 20, which is also below the legal drinking age in the US. . Visualizing Incident Counts by Age (Bar Plot) .
