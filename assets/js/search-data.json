Wikipedia | Understanding Reddit: A beginner’s guide to the front page of the internet | . What is Reddit? As of February 2021, Reddit ranks as the 18th-most-visited website in the world and 7th most-visited website in the U.S., according to Alexa Internet. Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members. What is a subreddit Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called &quot;communities&quot; or &quot;subreddits&quot;, which cover a variety of topics such as news, politics, religion, science, movies, video games, music, books, sports, fitness, cooking, pets, and image-sharing. Upvoting and Downvoting Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough up-votes, ultimately on the site&#39;s front page Subreddit Tabs At the top of each page on Reddit, you will see a selection of tabs marked Hot, New, Rising, Controversial, Top, Gilded, and Wiki. Here’s what they mean. Hot posts are the posts that have been getting the most upvotes and comments recently on that subreddit. Goals . Details This notebook will focus on &#39;Hot&#39; (see &#39;What are subreddit tabs&#39;) posts due to their focus on upvotes and recent comments. Data from /r/politics will be scrapped using python library Praw. Analysis will include determining top posts for this subreddit and understanding what factors contributed to their ranking beyond most upvotes and comments. Such as the correlation between comments and points, word frequency and semantic analysis of post titles Results . Correlation of Post Score and Number of Comments Heatmap run through Seaborn showed there was a very positive correlation between the number of comments and the score of a posts (0.89). Word Frequency of Post Titles Word frequency showed that presidents Biden and Trump were the most popular key words, followed by &#39;GOP&#39;. Sentiment Analysis The Majority of posts in /r/politics were found be Neutral, followed by negative. Setup Data Exploration .

Details Provide an overview of incidents that involve fireworks. This includes understaing which age groups are most affected and frequency of injury types. Provide sales figures for fireworks across the US. Conclusions . Injuries Ages 0-20 showed the highest rate of injury. Injury rates by age decrease with age. The 60+ age groups showed the lowest rate of injury Injuries to the hands, face, and eyes were the most common, while injuries to lower extemities were less common. Sales The state of Missouri held the record for most spent on fireworks (over 250 million dollars over the past 5 years). For comparision, Alaska spent around 560,000 dollars with the last five years Correlation There was no significate correlation between the number of injuries in a year compared to the number of sales.

Fixing Age Column | . Details The Age column list not only numeric ages but also includes category codes for individuals under the age of 2 year old. Individuals that are under 2 years old are given a code starting with 200 combined with their age in months. If the patient is older than 115 years old, code the age as 115 and indicate the actual age in the Comment. If the ED record indicates the patient was born on January 1, 1900, please verify the patient’s age with hospital staff – some hospitals use this date when the patient’s age is unknown. Note CPSC prefers that coders use the Date of Birth variable in lieu of the age variable. Mistakes in coded ages are common when patients have birthdays after the date of treatment and before the NEISS coder codes the case. Hospital medical record systems automatically update the age of the patient daily. # Age Codes age_code = {0:&#39;No Recorded Age&#39;, 2:&#39;2 Years Old&#39;, 45:&#39;45 Years Old&#39;, 100:&#39;100 Years Old&#39;, 102:&#39;102 Years Old&#39;, 201:&#39;Three Weeks Old&#39;, 201:&#39;Four Weeks Old&#39;, 201:&#39;Seven Weeks Old&#39;, 202:&#39;Ten Weeks Old&#39;, 209:&#39;Nine Months Old&#39;, 212:&#39;Twelve months (one year)&#39;, 218:&#39;Eighteen months&#39;} # my_dict = {&#39;Computer&#39;:1500,&#39;Monitor&#39;:300,&#39;Printer&#39;:150,&#39;Desk&#39;:250} age_codes = pd.DataFrame(list(age_code.items()),columns = [&#39;Age_Code&#39;,&#39;Description&#39;]) #Display Age Codes and Description age_codes . .

The data needed to be converted to csv since reading excel into pandas is extremely slow. CSV did create larger files but the trade off for increased reading speeds was worth it.

I have been a hobbiest programmer most of life and discovered Data Science and Analytics on accident while looking for methods to automate work projects such as creating advanced spreadsheet formulas for cleaning and merging. At one point I even installed a SuperSQL in Google Sheets as a means to create a locaized database because discovering python and other modern data handling methods. . I’m currently based out of Orlando, FL where I am currenlty enrolled in an MS Data Analytics (Big Data) program at the University of Central Florida. When I’m not programming or reading about Data Science you can usually find my playing with photography, practicing yoga, or learning to cook some korean/indian food. .",
